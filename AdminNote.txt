To enter data into database is tedious by entering row wise, for that we have reduced complexity by 
simple inputting a txt,rtf,text files with nexeccary data, given below are the skeletons of how those files 
should look:

**** transitProvider (buses, trams,metro, rail) ex for bus ****
busname nooftimings busTimesofNwithSpaces
ex:
10 5 10:30 11:30 12:30 1:30 2:30
**** transitLocation(stops,stations) ex for busstop ****
stopname 
ex:
uppal 
*** After all stops are defined **
**neighbor nodes
stopname noOfNeighbors nNeighborNodesWithSpacesDistanceTime
ex:
uppal 4 nagole 10 5 ramanthapur 4 5 habsiguda 9 9 boduppal 1 5
note: here distance was considered km and time as min nagole 10 5 means uppal to nagole distance is
** special nodes
stopname noOfSpecialNodes mSpecialNodesWithSpacesDistanceTime
ex:
uppal 3 Secunderabad Koti L.B.Nagar
**** transitHolder(bus-stop relations) ****(defined only after all providers and locations are defined)
stopname busname
ex:
